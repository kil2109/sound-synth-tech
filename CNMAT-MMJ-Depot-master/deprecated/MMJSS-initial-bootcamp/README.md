Music-158: Initial template
===

This portion of the pedagogy repository represents an initial push to get "bootcamp materials", from the MMJ summer school at CNMAT into the Music dept of UC Berkeley.  

These materials were built and curated by Jeff Lubow, with the aid of John MacCallum and Adrian Freed.

Historical
===

The first time the materials were offered was in MMJSS of 2011.

This set of files was used with a game controller called a "Madcatz Gametrak", which was used as an augmentation to a virtual golf game.  Participants used this controller as a way to get data into Max/MSP at a high rate, as they explored the various materials you see here through lectures, PDF instruction, and in-class participation.

Further developments
===
The controller used in the course in 2013 and 2014 was an Arduino Esplora, custom modified by Adrian Freed and Jeff Lubow.  The controller's code leveraged a SLIP-OSC encoding that allows "odot bundles" to be encoded and decoded via the serial stream on participants' computers.  The idea was to utilize odot bundles directly from and to Max/MSP in such a way that data managmement became more or less seamless.  For further information, see the [current odot readme](https://github.com/CNMAT/CNMAT-odot/blob/master/README.md)
